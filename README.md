## ðŸš€ About The Project

Pneumonia is a life-threatening lung infection that causes millions of deaths annually. Early and accurate diagnosis is critical for effective treatment, and medical imaging like chest X-rays plays a vital role. However, manual diagnosis can be time-consuming and prone to error.

This project implements a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)**, a deep learning model, to automate the detection of pneumonia from chest X-ray images. The model is trained to classify images as either **'Normal'** or **'Pneumonia'**, serving as a powerful tool to assist medical professionals.

## ðŸ’¾ Dataset

This project utilizes the **"Chest X-Ray Images (Pneumonia)"** dataset, which is a popular, publicly available collection on Kaggle.

* **Source:** [Kaggle Dataset Link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia)
* **Content:** The dataset contains 5,863 chest X-ray images (JPEG) organized into two categories: `PNEUMONIA` and `NORMAL`.
* **Details:** The images are from retrospective cohorts of pediatric patients of one to five years old.

## ðŸ¤– Model Architecture

The core of this project is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) built using TensorFlow and Keras. The architecture is designed to effectively learn features from the X-ray images.

* The model consists of multiple **convolutional layers** (with `ReLU` activation) to extract features like edges and textures.
* **Max-pooling layers** are used to downsample the feature maps, reducing computational complexity and making the model more robust.
* **Data augmentation** techniques (e.g., rotation, zoom, flips) were applied during training to prevent overfitting.
* The final layers consist of **dense (fully connected) layers** that perform the final classification.

## ðŸ“ˆ Results & Performance

The model was trained and evaluated, achieving high performance metrics in distinguishing between healthy and infected lungs.

* **Training Accuracy:** ~97%
* **Validation Accuracy:** ~95%
* **Key Metrics:** High Precision and Recall, indicating a low rate of false positives and false negatives.
